                <h3>My Summary Of The Article</h3>
                <p>To Summarize, this article goes into the capabilities of AI and the grand-impact of <i>Generative AI</i>. Showcasing its ability to create and generate diverse content types, it also indulges in the fact that although its primarily cloud based that it still requires some sort of human input, personally I believe the use of AI is justified aslong as its being properly disclosed and isn't being used in a malicious way.</p>
