                <h3>My Summary Of The Article</h3>
                <p>To summarize, this article goes over the studies of "CMU" otherwise known as Carnegie Mellon University researchers creating a method harnessing WiFi signals to detect human body shapes and movements, I think this can be a good and bad thing cause if used properly it can be a major strength in war or just investigation techniques done by Police, but if given to the wrong people it can be abused.</p>
