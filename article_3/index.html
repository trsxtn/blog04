                <h3>My Summary Of The Article</h3>
                <p>To summarize, this article goes over the Japanese government introducing "OriHime", a nine-inch-tall robot that aids individuals with extreme social withdraw. I think this can be a good and bad thing, cause one it allows people who are maybe to afraid to go outside to have an outlet to relief stress but also enables them to be stuck in their ways and doesn't allow self growth to any extent, I think it could work if limited in a sense, where they slowly become more integrated within society then eventually they have to leave their house upon feeling comfortable enough to do so. Regardless, I found this read pretty interesting.</p>
