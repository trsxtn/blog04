                <h3>My Summary Of The Article</h3>
                <p>To summarize, this article covers the recent advancements made by Google in the AI Space, more specifically the release of Gemini. If you're unfamiliar with it its essentially googles version of ChatGPT but more advanced, while ChatGPT showcased the power of text-powered AI googles version will also comprehend audio, video and images. This is both good and bad news, as mentioned prior throughout the course ChatGPT is currently being abused and assuming this will be public we'll most likely see the impacts of that sometime soon.</p>
